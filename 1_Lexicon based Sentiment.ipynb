       "154350  baronet coffee fair trade organic small village blend (140 g), 18-count coffee pods (pack of 3 bags) i will not purchase these coffee pods in the bags again.  i will purchase this same coffee in a box where the pods are individually wrapped in sealed packets.  the first thing i noticed about the coffee pods that i got in the bags was they had less coffee in them.  also, grounds had escaped from some of the pods and settled in the bottom of the bag.  what a mess - so i had to throw most of those out.  check out the amount per pod that you get in the bagged coffee vs the boxed coffee.  the bag states 140 g in 18 pods which is 7.7 per pod.  the box states that the pods are 10 grams, which is a thicker pod and better coffee.<br /><br />update on 6/6/12 - i should have stated that i have a keurig machine that i have a holder for that the pods to fit in, instead of using k-cups.  the 10 gram pods are just right for that and it costs a lot less to make coffee this way.  i didn't know abou...   \n",

       "121272        does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly wilton's black sparkle gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  i used it on sugar cookies to make \"ladybug spots and antennae,\" which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug \"heads\") very difficult.<br /><br />but the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (i left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  after putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. f, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  i have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  it would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  i would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.   \n",
