# sentiment-analysis

We will cover 3 main approaches of sentiment analysis - Lexicon based, Libraries based and ML based

**Approach 1:** Lexicon based approach : The first approach and lets start simple - we will be using a standard lexicon based approach to classify positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Lexicons are a list of words that represent a concept. We would use some lexicons available in the internet for classifying positive negative, neutral. Refer 1_Lexicon based Sentiment.ipynb for this approach

**Approach 2 :** Buildng rules on top of lexicons. Refer 2_Lexicon based Sentiment_ver2_vader. We also introduce Vader in this code

**Approach 3:** ML based Sentiment analysis. The output of the lexicon based sentiment code is the input to this step. Since the daata is large it can be downloaded from the below link

These codes, approach and data is from my book "Practical Natural Language Processing with Python" from Apress publications (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6246-7, https://www.amazon.in/Practical-Natural-Language-Processing-Python/dp/148426245X)
